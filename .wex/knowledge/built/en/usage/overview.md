## Configuration

```yaml
# config/packages/wexample_symfony_remote_payment_stripe.yaml
wexample_symfony_remote_payment_stripe:
  secret_key: '%env(default::STRIPE_SECRET_KEY)%'
  webhook_secret: '%env(default::STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET)%'   # of the endpoint /_payment/webhook/stripe
  methods: [card, sepa_debit, bancontact]
```

Point a Stripe webhook endpoint at `/_payment/webhook/stripe` with the `payment_intent.*` events. Without a secret key the provider reads Unconfigured and refuses calls.

Balance transactions are read oldest first, with their payment (PaymentIntent) when the source is a charge, so accounting matches them with the invoices paid online.
